# FlashCards Terminal Game

## Abstract

The goal of this project was to practice using test driven development to complete a partially written flashcard app to be played through the console. Using mocha and chai for testing, I developed unit tests to drive the implementation of code. The result of the project is a thoroughly-tested, fully functional flashcard study application.

## Installation / Setup

Clone down the repo from Github. Run the command `npm test` to install any dependencies. To view unit tests and their statuses, use the command `npm test`. 

To launch the flashcard game, run the command `node index.js`. The game will automatically display the first question; to answer enter the number that corresponds with your guess and press `enter`. After your result is displayed, hit press `enter` again to move on to the next question.


## Linting Your Code

Run the command in your terminal `npm run lint` to run the linter on your JavaScript code. There will be errors and warnings right from the start in this starter kit - the linter is still running successfully.

Your linter will look at the JavaScript files you have within the `src` directory and the `test` directory.
